                I'm so so so happy to be with you again and I will forever be grateful for showing me how it feels to be loved (pretend it's past, present, and future tense cause that's what I mean hehe…) Looking back on everything and how it turned out now, I hope it’ll be a memory that we can look back on and smile and laugh at together saying “OH MY GOSH can you believe we made it past all of that” cuddling in each other's arms and eating the yummiest food that we cooked tgtt. I love spending time with you whether it’s in person and going on little adventures across the city for alcohol, spending time outside during the night, cuddling and letting me fall asleep in your arms (sorry for twitching…), or just small past times like falling asleep on call tgt or watching you study while I rant about some random stuff that happened at school, every moment I spend with you makes me fall in love harder and harder. I miss the feeling of the big fat hugs I give you before you have to go, the touch of your lips when we make out, and the little hair tugs you give me when we're together. It makes me feel all types of fuzziness in my body and although I’ll always be a bit sad that I can’t feel your touch, I think being able to miss you as much as I do tells me enough that I love you so so much with all my heart that I yearn to see you everyday!! Looking into the future, although it's still a bit scary and really uncertain I want to continue being there for you in your high and lows  and trying my best to support you every way I can, if you ever need help or miss me or anything I will always try my best to be there for you and help you through whatever you need because I love you so so much!! Whether it's the past, present, or future, I know I have, do, and will love you for as long as you let me sooo excuse me for this slightly corny line… but even though time continues to move forward I hope I can make you feel loved in every time frame whether I have to travel backwards or forwards to reach you <3 I love you so sooo much baby and thank you for letting me be your valentine!!
